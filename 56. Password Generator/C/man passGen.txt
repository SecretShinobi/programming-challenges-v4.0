NAME
	passgen - print out a password
	
SYNOPSIS
	passgen NUM [OPTION...] 

DESCRIPTION
	passgen creates a NUM long password string. By default, passgen 
	creates a string of NUM random lowercase characters. Including 
	tokens specified in OPTIONS will affect what characters can 
	appear in the string
	
	The ordering of the tokens do not matter, so as long as they are
	in OPTIONS, they are valid modifiers for the program
	
OPTIONS
	-n
		Include numbers 0-9 in the password string
	-u
		Include uppercase characters in the password string
	-s
		Include special characters in the password string

EXIT STATUS
	On successfully generating and printing the password string to 
	stdout, return 0. Otherwise, return 1

NOTES
	This is currently a barebones basic implementation of a password 
	generator and is meant to print a password to stdout. There will
	be an option to print the password to a specified file
	
	Additional exit status/return codes will be implemented to the 
	program as they arise

EXAMPLES
       	Generate a simple lowercase password of length 10
    	
    	    $ passgen 10
    	    
    	This will print a string with 10 lowercase letters to stdout, like
    	'nkleqwoasd' or 'efnlkpoija'
    	
    	
    	Generate an alphanumeric password with length 7
    	
    	    $ passgen 7 -n -u
    	
    	This would print a string with 7 alphanumeric characters to stdout
    	like 'asFWjnmk32' or '3FSw03mma5'. 
    	
    	Generating a password of length 12 with all options enabled
    	
    	    $ passgen 12 -u -n -s
    	    
    	This would print a string with 12 random characters to stdout, like
    	'23fQWE@!q4' or 'fwF@r423!a'
