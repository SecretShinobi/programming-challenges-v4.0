## Overview

This implementation is a command-line program that generates a password

## Notes
Due to how C deals with strings and characters, we can create a random 
password by generating random numbers within 32-127, as these are the 
codes for the ASCII printable characters
- Codes 48-57 are the numbers 0-9
- Codes 65-90 are the uppercase characters
- Codes 97-122 are the lowercase characters
- The other codes (excluding 32 and 127) are the special characters

I tried writing this code following the UNIX philosophy by making the
code modular, specialized and able to handle text streams. The main 
challenge for me is figuring out what pieces of code I should make as 
functions to put in the custom header library

## Method
One way of implementing this is to generate a random number and 
get a random ASCII code based on the specified options. Then add
this character to the password and repeat until the string length is 
equal to the specified number. Print the string to stdout once done
